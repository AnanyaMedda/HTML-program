             River. Built in the year 1696, the fort is named after King William III and was the first stronghold of the
             British in the country. The magnificent structure is spread over 70.9 acres and is embellished with
             hundreds of arched windows that overlook lush green gardens. Meticulous stonework adorns the surface of the
             building and it took as long as took ten years to reach completion. However, it was soon realized that the
             building had a few loopholes, and a new octagonal building was constructed whose foundation was laid by Sir
             Robert Clive.<br>
